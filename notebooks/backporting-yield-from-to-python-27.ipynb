Whoever chose `yield` as the name of the generator keyword was a _genius_; \"yield\" in English can be used in one of two ways: a recipe can \"yield\" a dozen cookies, or a refining process can \"yield\" iron ingots from ore, but a car can also \"yield\" way to another car, or a ruler can \"yield\" their command to someone else. \"Yield\" signifies both production of some item or items via some process, as well as deference or delegation of control to something else - and Python's `yield` captures both these meanings _precisely_*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* _Although the second meaning didn't apply when the keyword was first introduced, so take what you will from this - either magnificent foresight, or an auspicious decision in hindsight._\n",

Of course, we could just have `scrape_and_process` only call `next(g)` that many times - but supposing that we'd maybe want `scrape_links` to prioritize some links over others, based not only on the links themselves, but the number of pages to scrape? Maybe `.php` pages take 5 times longer on average than `.html` to request, but are much more valuable - but, if we're only going to be allowed to scrape a single page, that means the `.php` probably doesn't have time to load at all, and so we'd better try a `.html`?

Via the AST, we can [create domain-specific languages](https://github.com/hchasestevens/xpyth), [write custom linting rules](https://github.com/hchasestevens/bellybutton), [search our codebases](https://github.com/hchasestevens/astpath), and even [automatically evolve code](https://github.com/hchasestevens/monkeys), all in a robust and easy way. Fully explaining the AST is a bit outside the scope of this piece, but those interested should take a look at the [green tree snakes guide to Python ASTs](https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as well as the [official Python `ast` module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html).\n",

We can use the `ast` module to see what these look like as represented in the AST:"

Since this will not be true generally in Python 2.7, let's instead make a deliberate `hasattr` check on `.value`, and assign the last yielded value from `EXPR` to `RESULT` in the case where no such attribute exists.

    "## Concluding remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, for the convenience of those stuck maintaining Python 2.7 codebases, I have made this [`yield from` backport](https://github.com/hchasestevens/yield-from) available as a PyPI package, installable via:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install yield-from\n",
    "```\n",
    "This PyPI package also handles the case of `RESULT = yield_from(EXPR)`, which we did not cover in the above code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, aside from the specific case of backporting `yield from`, it is hopefully clear that the AST manipulation techniques presented in this piece are applicable to a far broader range of situations - for instance, [pattern matching](https://github.com/Suor/patterns), [performance optimization](https://github.com/vstinner/fatoptimizer), [building DSLs](https://github.com/hchasestevens/xpyth), [generating javascript](http://hackflow.com/blog/2015/04/12/metaprogramming-beyond-decency-part-2/), [creating more readable tests](https://chezsoi.org/lucas/blog/pytest-ast-modification-getting-the-tests-final-code.html), and, generally, anywhere you wish Python could be doing a find-replace on your codebase for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that AST manipulation isn't without its drawbacks, some quite serious. Perhaps most perniciously, your source code becomes a lie: what you see is not what gets run, and oftentimes stack traces no longer line up nicely with the code you've manipulated. Furthermore, understanding the manipulation requires a lot of background knowledge (you've just read an entire article on it), placing an unavoidable and onerous expectation on anyone looking to work with or maintain the codebase - a problem, especially, for junior developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with any powerful tool, determining the circumstances under which the benefits AST manipulation can bring outweigh these drawbacks is best left to the discretion of you, the reader."
